# What is this about?

In this class, Math 211, we will use technology to do all our calculations. These notes will introduce most the topics neeed to solve all problems in this class.
## Usage

I will add examples along the quarter. In particular, I will be adding worked examples prior to our `R`-assignments, so that you can answer the assignments  after going through the examples on these notes.
